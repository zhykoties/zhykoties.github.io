      - Mentor: Dr. Tieying Zhang
      - Worked on the ByteBrain team. We focus on ML for Infrastructure.
      - I was primarily involved in two projects: 1. time series representation learning with contrastive learning, as well as interpretable time series forecasting by attending to the most relevant candidate sequence in the history; 2. virtual machine rescheduling using reinforcement learning, involving transformers and risk-seeking RL.
      - I was also involved in a third project on job scheduling in the cloud.

      - Predicted conference room occupancy for WeWork offices; improved forecasting accuracy by 30% compared to the original implementation.
      - Introduced a non-autoregressive transformer that lowers the time complexity for multi-step forecasting from O(L) to O(1).
      - Proposed a novel training technique for transformers on small-scale datasets.

      - Mentors: Dr. Nicholas Malaya, Dr. Alan Lee
      - Sponsored by AMD, the project was to explore the resiliency of convolutional neural networks to reduced numerical precisions.
      - Showed that larger batch sizes might lead to poorer results under low precision via simulated experiments and delivered preliminary proofs for error scaling in forward and backward propagations.
